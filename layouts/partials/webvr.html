For those that are not able to experience a full or part VR experience, we can fallback to rich interactive content that allows everyone to access it. We always build our WebVR projects in a progressively enhanced way.</p>

		<p class="homepage-body dark-body">Our VR experiences can be crafted to your needs to work on any OR all of the popular VR devices and use all of their functionality, whilst also supporting the most primitive version.</p>

		<p class="homepage-body dark-body">We use responsive design principles and progressive enhancement to ensure that your content is available on any device.</p>
