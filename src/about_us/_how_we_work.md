# How we work

We make cool stuff, useful stuff, entertaining stuff.

We work like :

## Fixed time, fixed price, fixed scope , for a client:
 
* Expensive - 100% profit on hourly rate + Massive buffer to mitigate risks on time / scope
* Not Agile, no iteration, big bang, requires very detailed scope up front, which is effort in itself.
* Only suitable for small scopes, time critical.
* Issues for us with having a pool of people that are 'on the bench' ready to do this stuff at a moments notice.

## Time & materials, fixed scope for a client:

* Still expensive - 60% profit on hours, but smaller risk buffer
* Can be Agile-ish (like Sapient Approach), but still probably requires detailed up front scope.
* Can be for bigger scopes but harder to meet deadlines if there are unforseen issues.

## T&M - agile, client retains full IP

*
