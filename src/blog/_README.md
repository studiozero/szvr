# Actually, don't read me.

Just so you know, you can create a folder here called `_drafts` and it'll be ignored by git. Which will mean it's a safe(ish) place to store those half-baked ideas that might be a bit embarrassing.

If you want to move something from `_drafts` to be stored in github, but don't want it published, you can simply add an underscore '_' to the start of the file, and it'll be ignored by the publish mechanism. e.g.

````
// not on github
    /blog/_drafts/some_article.md
    
// not published by this system
    /blog/_some_article.md
    
// will get published
    /blog/some_article.md
````
