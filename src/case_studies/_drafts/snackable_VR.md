# Snackable VR

## What is 'snackable VR?'

'Snackable VR' is our phrase for short, shareable, go-anywhere VR experiences. They're aimed at mobile web VR users, but can be easily used on desktop VR systems like the Vive or Rift.

Typically, mobile users don't want to spend extended periods in VR. Cardboard headsets are uncomfortable, the gaming experiences are limited by lack of roomscale and accurate controllers, and processor and bandwidth limitations mean that experiences are not as rich as desktop VR.

However, many years of web development have taught us that if you make experiences responsive to the devices and context of use, you can create engaging experiences.

### The Movie Poster

Our first concept was the 'Movie poster' - an embeddable, easily shareable VR snack. With the imminent release of 'Rogue One', we created a 360 space to play the trailer for the film. 

It had 3 main elements: The trailer itself, a 'lobby card' of the main characters, and a themed 360 image. The idea is to evoke some of the excitement of being in a cinema lobby, waiting to go in to see a great movie.

 ### The Countdown
 
 Our second concept was slightly more elborate. We're big fans of Netflix's 'Stranger things' and were eagerly anticipating the release of season 2. Again, we wanted to make something that would appeal to other fans, and would be shared easily.
 
 This time, we wanted to capture the enigmatic feel of the stranger things world.
