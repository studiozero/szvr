# About the YAML

* **_date_** :        Every page / post needs a date - preferably with a time, but it's no biggy. It's best if you use ISO format "YY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ"
* **_image_** :       Put your large image in the `/artwork` directory, and put the filename (not the full path) in here. Or, you can simply put a html colour hexcode - e.g. `#f9fefe`  
* **_title_** :       The title of your page 
* **_sell_** :        A very short 'sell' - max 80 chars
* **_summary_** :     A slightly longer summary
* **_description_** : A full description / opening paragraph. Used for RSS feeds, facebook posts etc.
* **_author_** :      Your name
* **_authorLink_** :  Link to you or your profile, or anything you can link to on the web. Spotify track perhaps?

So it looks a bit like : 

```yaml
