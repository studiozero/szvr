		| Thanks to new standard APIs, we are able to build Virtual Reality expiriences for the browser, and for those that are not able to expirience a full or part VR expirience, we can fallback to rich interactive content that allows everyone to access it. We always build our WevVR projects in a progressive enhanced way.
