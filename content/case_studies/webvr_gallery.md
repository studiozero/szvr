An artist might have hundreds of painting and pieces of Art, but they might have a very limited space when it comes to an exhibition. The WebVR Gallery allows any artist
to create a small, interactive and immersive space to place their art, be it paintings, scultures or even VR art.

A user is able to walk around the Gallery and get as close to the art as possible. When on Mobile the user has a Magic Window into the gallery. If required, movement and 
interaction could be added for mobile users.
