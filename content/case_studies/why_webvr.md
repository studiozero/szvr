WebVR enables us to build cross-platform, cross device VR experiences.

VR has the potential to let people explore and create in amazing new ways.

		
It should be easy to access and not require a specific app download that is only locked down to a specific device, it should be as easy as things already are shared on the web.

We build these things the same way we build things for the web, with JavaScript. 

Responsive Design and Progressive enhancement principles ensure that the content can be consumed on any device. We can optimize the intereaction model for the device being used. 

Desktop = Mouse Drag and Click to interact. 

Tablet = Drag with finger and tap to interact

Mobile = Phones accelerometer is used to provide a 'Magic Window'

DayDream View = Uses the controller
