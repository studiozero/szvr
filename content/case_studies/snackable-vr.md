## What is 'Snackable VR?'

'Snackable VR' is our phrase for short, shareable, go-anywhere VR experiences. They're aimed at mobile web VR users, but can be easily used on desktop VR systems like the Vive or Rift.

Typically, mobile users don't want to spend extended periods in VR. Cardboard headsets can be uncomfortable, the gaming experiences are limited by lack of roomscale and accurate controllers, and processor and bandwidth limitations mean that experiences are not as rich as desktop VR.

However, many years of web development have taught us that if you make experiences responsive to the devices and context of use, you can create engaging experiences.

## The Movie Poster

Our first concept was the 'Movie poster' - an embeddable, easily shareable VR snack. With the imminent release of 'Rogue One', we created a 360 space to play the trailer for the film. 

It had 3 main elements: The trailer itself, a 'lobby card' of the main characters, and a themed 360 image. The idea is to evoke some of the excitement of being in a cinema lobby, waiting to go in to see a great movie.

## Reactions

This was really only intended to be a technical demo, but the responses we had were very positive.

This demo has also lead to a number of engagements with marketing agencies keen to make their own 'Snackable VR' experiences.

## The Countdown
 
 Our second concept was slightly more elborate. We're big fans of Netflix's 'Stranger things' and were eagerly anticipating the release of season 2. Again, we wanted to make something that would appeal to other fans, and would be shared easily. There's a long tradition of Countdown sites, usually leading up to film releases, start times for season premieres and 'on sale' times for tickets. We felt Stranger Things was deserving of it's own.
 
 Again, the elements were relatively simple. There was a promo video for the show, a 360 scene of the Byer's living room, and a giant countdown clock, lovingly rendered in the iconic Stranger Things font.

## Results
 
 This time, we wanted to track the response, and we really underestimated the kind of traffic it would generate. In 3 days after launch, we'd had around 6.5 thousand unique visitors. This tailed off after the inital hit, but we're still seeing organic traffic 2 months later.
